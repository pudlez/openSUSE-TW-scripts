## About me/this project
A friend recommend that I give tumbleweed a try. Since I like rolling distros (I come from Gentoo), I decided to install it on my Thinkpad X1 Carbon (i7-1365U, 32G) using FDE+TPM and dualbooting with windows (for the rare occasions I have to use it). Previously, my only exposure to SUSE was SLES on a Mainframe (s390x) many years ago... Since I don't really know/remember a ton from it, I will be making scripts to handle some stuff and thought I would upload them to github for others to contribute, use, or get an idea of how to do something.
